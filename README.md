_Firefox Tab Suspender_ is an open source extension for Firefox Browser 59+.


Extension's target are people who use older computers or just want to reduce browser's ram usage. For this reasons I strive to make _Firefox Tab Suspender_ lightweight and performant as much as it is possible.

After install, extension will suspend unused cards according to user's settings.

Thanks to author of Chrome's 
[The Great Suspender](https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender). Notice that _Firefox Tab Suspender_ at the base is highly inspired by his work.
